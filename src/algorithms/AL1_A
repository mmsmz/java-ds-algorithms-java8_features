// Agenda for this course (PART ONE)
------------------------------------
- Arrays
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queses
- Binary search trees
- Balanced trees: AVL and red-black trees
- Splay trees
- Binary heaps
- Hashtables
- Tries

Why do we use Data structures?
- Data Structures : to store data in an efficient way
- We often have the intuition -> if we want to make an algorithm fast, then we have to optimize it. We have write it in
  C++ or C and it is going to be the fasted algorithm possible.
- And we have to avoid nested forloops and to make every calculation as fast as possible.
- But basically algorithms can be boosted up by proper data structures.
- Data structures make sure running time will be better

Abstract Data Types
--------------------
Basically this is the model (logical description) for a certain data structure
